## Local Install
HelpMe can be installed natively (python 3 recommended) with pip:

```bash
pip install helpme
```

or you can clone and install from source:

```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/vsoch/helpme
$ cd helpme
$ python setup.py install
```

If you want to install dependencies for a particular helper, you can specify
the helper like this:

```bash
pip install helpme[uservoice]
```

When you have installed HelpMe, there will be an executable "helpme"
placed in your bin folder:

```bash
which helpme
helpme
```

## Docker
You can also use the helpme Docker image (note this has not been rigorously tested). You will
need to run the image and supply any needed variables to the container with `--env`. Here is an
example for the default Github and a personal access token:

```
$ docker run -it --env HELPME_GITHUB_TOKEN=123 vanessa/helpme github
[helpme|github]
Hello Friend! I'll help you post a Github issue today.
What is the Github repository to post to? (e.g., username/reponame): 
...
```

And of course you can customize the installed configuration and build the image yourself!

```
$ git clone https://www.github.com/vsoch/helpme
$ cd helpme
$ docker build -t vanessa/helpme .
```

## Singularity
You can use the same Docker image with Singularity, and it's recommended to pull first.

```bash
singularity pull --name helpme.sif docker://vanessa/helpme
export HELPME_GITHUB_TOKEN=123
./helpme.sif github
```

Next, why don't you read about how to post Github issues from the command line by
using the [github](/helpme/helper-github) helper.
